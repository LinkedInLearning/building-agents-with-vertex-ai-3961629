# Building Agents with Vertex AI
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Building Agents with Vertex AI`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Prerequisites
To follow along with this course and build your own agents, you need an activated Google Cloud account. You can set one up at [https://cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com). During the setup process you will be asked provide your name, address, email address, and a valid credit card.  

## Exercise files
This repository has an `/assets` folder with materials you can use as you follow along with the course. The assets are provided as-is and you can use them and edit them in any way you like to build your own agents.

The files provided are:
- `/assets/google-maps-geocoding-api-OpenAPI-schema.yaml`
- `/assets/vancouver-neighbourhoods.txt`

You'll be prompted when to access and use these files in the course.

## Documentation
The Vertex AI Agent Builder is a rapidly evolving project and while this course gives you a comprehensive breakdown of how to use this tool, there are many features and details not covered in the course. 

To bridge this gap there is a `documentation.md` file in the root of this repo with links to relevant documentation and further details.
